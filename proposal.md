## Developing a causal framework based on counterfactual theories of causation and causal DAGs and SWIGs

The goal of this project is to develop a framework of graph theory based approach to understanding causal inference from observational studies using counterfactual theories of causation. The notion of causality is important for social sciences, health sciences, epidemiology, and related fields but these fields also do not allow for true experiements that are possible with animal models. Therefore, model based approaches to understand whether X causes Y in these fields is dependent on expensive randomised trials that are limited in external validity (that is, these studies cannot be easily generalised to populations other than those studied). On the other hand, graph based approaches using directed path analysis and directed acyclic paths are convenient tools to unravel the causal structure (whether X causes Y); however, while it is intuitive to use causal diagrams using directed acyclic graphs to understand the flow of time and causal mechanisms across various domains, the interpretations are not straightforward; hence, a variant of directed acyclic graphs, single world intervention graphs are used to assimilate counterfactual theories of causation. Counterfactual theories of causation address the issue of causal inference by modelling 'what if' scenarios of potential effects if all individuals were to receive a treatment as opposed to some receiving alternative forms of treatments in causal inference. Here, while conceptually intuitive, using a graph theory, estimation of such models involve non-parametric structural equation models (NPSEM). While some research and approaches are available in public health and epidemiology, more research need to be conducted to develop model based approaches to under causal frameworks in a variety of settings. We will address such situations in this project.

In this project, we will examine the role of directed acyclic graphs in population health and epidemiology, and will collaborate with colleagues in other domains. We will aim to develop free and open-source software packages and modules that will enable estimation of NPSEMs.

3) A short (several sentences) explanation of how you would spend the money. Note that funds would have to be entirely spent this calendar year.

We will use the allocated funds for the following purposes:
- Pay for stipend for a postgraduate student to collect data from different studies and assist with publications (20 hours/week * 16 weeks * 30 NZ$/hour = $9600)
- Publication costs (about $500 NZ Dollars)
- Total costs = NZ$ 11, 000
